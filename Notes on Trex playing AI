Notes on Trex playing AI

Problem Statement(Ideal scenario)
	We tell the AI what is "You Lost" screen. 
	We tell the AI that the game is scored based on "Time Played".
	We tell the AI what are the controls. We DO NOT tell what the controls do. 
	The robot figures out what the controls do. 
	The robot figures out what makes it win, and what makes it lose, by playing the game.
	It improves itself by self play, and beats humans.

Subproblem 1
	We tell the AI the controls, and we want the AI to figure out what the controls do. 

	Approach
	We take continuous screenshots of the game, while randomly playing with controls.
	We develop and algorithm that learns the changes caused to the game because of the user actions. 

	Idea 1
	Use some feature-detection and feature-matching(for eg. SIFT) to detect changes between adjacent frames. 
	Then, cluster based on
